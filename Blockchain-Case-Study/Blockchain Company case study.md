# Case Study on MINA Blockchain

## Overview of MINA Blockchain Technology

```python
('MINA Blockchain')
```
In the last three years, Mina Protocol's team has launched and learnt many testnet phases along with our wonderful community. O(1) Labs started an ambitious new open source project in June 2017 to create a layer-one protocol that might live up to blockchain's initial promise—true decentralisation, size and security. Mina proposes an elegant approach employing sophisticated encryption and rekursive zk-SNARKs instead of applying brute computational power. 

Developers may construct powerful applications, like Snapps3 (SNARK-powered apps), to give financial services to anybody from their phones without risking the privacy of data and programmable money. And that's only the start.

## Why MINA plays a huge role in the blockchain industry?

Mina is focusing on three use cases that will help us build a private gateway between the real world and crypto — and the infrastructure for the secure, democratic future we all deserve.

- End-to-End data privacy from online to on-chain
```
Without compromising sensitive personal information, users can access vital on-chain services. Instead, Mina is used to access its data online and demonstrate that it meets the service providers' standards. A trustworthy area cannot be harmed. There are no end-to-end data vulnerabilities. For example, Mina's Snapps can currently connect to a credit rating source to show that your credit value is more than a specified limit. Soon, from any website you will be able to prove so much more.
```
- Permissionless web oracles
```
Developers can use Snapps to build decentralised apps to use private, verified, real-world data from any website. You can enter any information freely available on the web (without the permission of the website). And only by providing the required evidence can they access, use and protect sensitive data. No trustworthy oracles or custom integrations of websites.
```
- One private interent login
```
Without opening an account and passing over his personal data, users can access a website or service privately. They connect with Mina safely, instead. They cannot be blocked by a centralised service provider. And chains-wide developers can add this safe, private option to their services.
```

## MINA future plans and interesting facts
With huge team and demo testnet in place, In 2022, 
- Mina promised full nodes run on mobile and web, this will make MINA the most accessible blockchain and deliver decentralization at scale.
- Implement on-chain protocol for treasury and budget, this will empower decentralized voting system and decision making for the MINA protocol.
